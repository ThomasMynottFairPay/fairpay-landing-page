# FairPay Church Giving Campaign - Implementation Guide

## Campaign Strategy Overview

### Campaign Name
**"Set it up now (not later)"**

### Core Problem
Churches lose potential recurring givers because:
1. Members have high intention in-service but low follow-through later
2. Traditional bank setup (BSB/account details) creates friction, especially for 18-40s
3. Admin teams spend excessive time chasing failed payments and reconciling

### Solution Positioning
FairPay provides the PayTo **workflow layer** (not just rails):
- Instant in-service setup via QR/link
- Bank-app approval (trusted, no forms)
- Automated recurring collection with retries
- Dashboard visibility and reconciliation

## 🎯 Target Audiences

### Audience A: Church Leadership (Decision Makers)
**Who:** Pastors, operations managers, treasurers, finance/admin teams

**Pain Points:**
- Unpredictable giving makes budgeting difficult
- Manual follow-ups waste ministry time
- Administrative overhead (reconciliation, failed payments)
- Younger members "don't set it up"

**Messaging Focus:**
- Less admin, more ministry
- Predictable giving + automation
- Real-time visibility + reconciliation
- "Stop chasing payments"

**CTAs:**
- Primary: "Book a 15-minute walkthrough"
- Secondary: "See a live demo"
- Tertiary: "Join early access waitlist"

### Audience B: Congregants (End Users / Givers)
**Who:** 18-40s, mobile-first, low tolerance for admin

**Behavior:**
- High intention in-the-moment
- Low follow-through later
- Trust banking app more than forms
- Want instant setup, not "homework"

**Messaging Focus:**
- Set it up NOW (not later)
- 30-second setup, done before you leave
- No forms, no bank details
- Bank-trusted, cancel anytime

**CTAs:**
- Primary: "Set up weekly giving in 30 seconds"
- Secondary: "Scan to give"
- Tertiary: "Learn more"

## 📢 Channel Deployment Strategy

### Channel 1: In-Service (Highest Conversion)
**When:** During giving (emotional + intentional peak)

**Format:**
- Giving slide pack with QR code
- Keep on screen 2-3 minutes
- Optional second slide: "Already giving? Thanks — you're covered."

**Why It Works:**
- Captures peak intention
- Social proof (everyone doing it together)
- No "later" required

**Slide Content:**
```
Title: "Set up weekly giving in 30 seconds"
- QR code (center, large)
- 3 bullets: "No forms • No bank details • Approve in your banking app"
- Reassurance: "Change/cancel anytime"
```

### Channel 2: Post-Service SMS (Conversion Capture)
**When:** 1-2 hours after service OR Monday evening

**Format:**
- Link to giving setup page
- Short, reassuring copy

**Example Copy:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for joining us today! If you'd like to set up regular giving, 
you can do it in 30 seconds here: [link]

Just approve in your banking app — no forms, no bank details needed.

Blessings,
[Church Name] Team
```

### Channel 3: Always-On (Website / Link-in-Bio)
**Where:**
- Church website giving page
- "Welcome to church" follow-up for newcomers
- Social media bios
- Email signatures

## 💬 Objection Handling

### Objection: "Our congregation prefers cash/check"
**Response:** 
"We get it — and FairPay doesn't replace that. It's an *option* for the 18-40s who are already mobile-first. Churches typically see 30-40% of younger members adopt it immediately because it matches how they already bank."

### Objection: "Is this secure? What about their bank details?"
**Response:**
"Great question! Members *never* share bank details with the church. They approve the mandate inside their own banking app (the same app they use every day). It's bank-level security, and they can cancel anytime directly in their app."

### Objection: "What if someone wants to stop giving?"
**Response:**
"They stay in complete control. They can pause, change the amount, or cancel anytime directly in their banking app. No need to contact the church office or fill out forms."

### Objection: "How much does this cost?"
**Response:**
"FairPay has no setup fees and typically costs less than traditional direct debit (lower transaction fees + no dishonour fees). Plus, you'll save 8+ hours/month in admin time. We can walk you through the exact pricing in a quick 15-minute call."

### Objection: "We already use [existing giving platform]"
**Response:**
"FairPay integrates with most platforms, and many churches use both — cards for one-time gifts, PayTo for recurring. The difference is the *in-service setup workflow*. That's where churches see the 40% uplift in recurring givers."
